    "You are given a dataset of magical creatures and their real-time activities.\n",
    "Each creature performs various activities with different durations throughout the day.\n",

    "- Calculate the total duration of activities for each creature.\n",
    "- Determine the creature with the longest single activity duration.\n",
    "- Identify the most common activity performed by each creature.\n",
    "- Calculate the average activity duration for each type of activity across all creatures.\n",
    "- Find the top 3 creatures with the highest average activity duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "creature_activities: Contains columns (creature_id, creature_name, activity, duration), where activity is the type of activity and duration is the time spent on that activity in minutes."
