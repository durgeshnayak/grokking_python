    "Question: Welcome to the Statistician's Nightmare!\n",
    "You are given a dataset of various magical creatures and their bizarre daily activities.\n",
    "The data is filled with quirky statistics and unusual measures.\n",
    "Your task is to perform statistical analysis to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the hours each creature spends on different activities.\n",
    "- Identify the creature with the highest variance in activity hours.\n",
    "- Determine the correlation between the number of magical spells cast and the hours spent on activities.\n",
    "- Find outliers in the dataset based on activity hours.\n",
    "- Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the average hours spent by creatures on \"Flying\" is different from \"Potion Making.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "creature_activities: Contains columns (creature_id, creature_name, activity, hours, spells_cast)."
